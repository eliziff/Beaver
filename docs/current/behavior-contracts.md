# Beaver behavior contracts

Status: current user-visible contract

These are capabilities and invariants that refactors preserve. Current module
boundaries are not contracts; neither are incidental response wording, CSS
classes, database column names, or a particular provider SDK.

## One application in local and cloud compositions

- Account-free local mode starts with anonymous identity and requires no cloud
  service.
- Cloud mode adds authentication, sharing, MFA, audit, private object storage,
  and account administration.
- Library, documents, projects, workflows, chats, tabular reviews, assistant
  tools, document actions, and their browser behavior use the same application
  operations and public resource semantics.
- A deployment adapter may change persistence or identity mechanics, never the
  ordinary product rule.
- An unavailable cloud-only account capability fails explicitly. It does not
  create a second local implementation.

## Growing resources

Projects, workflows, tabular reviews, Library directories, and project
directories provide:

- bounded pages with stable deterministic ordering;
- opaque cursors bound to the resource, normalized filters, and last row;
- owner/scope filtering before existence or payload is revealed;
- literal server-side search and exact-ID reads that do not scan a page;
- the same cursor and filter behavior in local and cloud compositions; and
- shared frontend paging/directory primitives rather than component-specific
  whole-collection caches.

System workflows remain a small pinned catalogue and do not need runtime
pagination or downloading.

## Documents and versions

- Original document bytes and immutable versions are authoritative.
- Each version has a stable document/version identity, monotonic version number,
  filename, media type, size, source hash, timestamp, and provenance where
  applicable.
- Reads and downloads honor an explicitly requested version rather than silently
  substituting the current one.
- Expected-parent or stale-receipt conflicts make no write.
- Replacing source bytes invalidates incompatible derived products.
- Deleting one version cannot remove bytes still referenced by another.
- PDF renditions and projections are derived, receipt-bound products. Their
  failure never corrupts or replaces the original.
- Evidence binds document, version, source hash, locator, and exact passage.
- DOCX generation/editing preserves unsupported package content, records owned
  mutations, and fails closed on unsafe boundaries.
- Tracked edits are reviewable and their accept/reject operations are
  conflict-safe.

Library and project folders preserve nested paths, reject cycles and foreign
IDs, and apply recursive deletion only to resources owned by the authenticated
scope.

## Assistant, agents, and tools

- Normal chat, project chat, Word chat, read subagents, and tabular work use one
  provider-neutral turn engine and executable tool registry.
- Advertised tools have handlers. Unavailable tools are omitted; unknown tools
  return bounded errors.
- The backend reconstructs authoritative history and state from durable records
  rather than trusting a browser-supplied transcript.
- Turn submission uses optimistic transcript versions. Conflicts do not create
  duplicate turns.
- Provider/tool work is cancellable, preserves usable partial events, and
  records one terminal outcome.
- Tool calls and results remain exactly paired. Document mutations are
  serialized per affected document while independent reads may proceed.
- Legal answers expose only grounded final prose and exact citations; rejected
  drafts are not presented as verified work.
- Provider-internal events remain private. One bounded public event stream feeds
  one frontend decoder and reducer.
- Chat, subagents, and tabular review are different presentations of ordinary
  agent jobs, not separate model loops.

## Legal sources and evidence

- Providers enter through the shared search, resolve, and bounded-read plane.
- Provider-native identifiers, structure, coverage, URLs, and provenance are
  preserved when available.
- Reconstructed structure fills genuine gaps but never overwrites authoritative
  native facts.
- Exact evidence carries the source/version identity, source hash, human locator
  where available, passage coordinates, and safe presentation link.
- Text-fragment and native-anchor URLs are built deterministically from verified
  source text. Models do not author source URLs.
- A failed external pinpoint falls back to a truthful provider anchor or the
  internal source viewer; it never fabricates precision.
- Quote presence, link validity, and semantic support are distinct findings.

## Durable jobs and work products

- Long work uses the shared durable job queue with progress, cancellation,
  restart recovery where supported, and usable partial results.
- Progress reports stable job/activity identities and never requires a second
  feature-specific run history.
- Generated documents are saved as immutable versions or Library work products
  with exact input versions and receipts.
- Authorities uses one maintained browser workspace and engine in its
  standalone and Beaver hosts.
- A standalone/embedded capability may change file-selection and save adapters;
  its analysis/build rules and primary UI remain singular.

## Browser and host behavior

- Beaver is one Vite/React Router application served from the Express origin.
- The Word task pane mounts the normal application at its Word route and reuses
  authentication, profile, chat, tools, jobs, and UI components.
- Library and project directory behavior is shared.
- Model and reasoning effort remain separate visible controls.
- Primary actions have stable labels and placement, keyboard operation, visible
  focus, truthful loading/progress/error states, and no reliance on color alone.
- Changed surfaces must remain usable at 320 CSS pixels, browser zoom, reduced
  motion, and Windows high contrast. Automated accessibility checks support but
  do not replace keyboard and screen-reader testing.

## Security boundaries

- Retrieved documents, OCR, provider text, fields, metadata, and summaries are
  untrusted data. They cannot authorize tools, change system instructions, or
  cross user/project/document scope.
- Local paths, credentials, provider internals, and raw stack errors are not
  exposed in public responses.
- Upload, archive, download, subprocess, URL, and object-storage boundaries
  validate size, type, path, ownership, and control characters.
- Cloud service credentials stay at deployment adapters. Local files never
  become cloud credentials.

## Proof

Test the smallest public outcome that protects each changed contract:

- application/repository contract tests for local and cloud compositions;
- route tests for authorization, validation, status, and public payload;
- focused turn/event/tool tests for assistant behavior;
- exact provider/structure fixtures and applicable corpus gates;
- DOCX package-part, accepted/redline, and render checks;
- frontend reducer/component/browser checks for visible behavior; and
- launcher-owned smoke for the complete local product.

Tests that merely assert an import, mock call order, implementation branch, CSS
class, or exact incidental copy do not make that implementation durable.
